# Design and Development of Emotion recognition System

This project focuses on the integration of emotion detection systems into real-world applications using advanced technologies such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and OpenCV. Emotion detection plays a crucial role in various fields, including mental health, human-computer interaction, business insights, security, and sentiment analysis. By leveraging deep learning models for facial emotion recognition and feature extraction, these systems offer valuable insights into individuals' emotional states, customer sentiments, and security concerns.

The project achieves an accuracy of 60% in emotion detection, showcasing its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. It explores the application of emotion detection systems in mental health scenarios to monitor emotional well-being and support individuals effectively. Additionally, it delves into enhancing human-computer interaction experiences by enabling personalized interactions based on user emotions. In business settings, these systems provide valuable customer insights by analyzing emotions and sentiments to tailor products and services accordingly.

# Demo

This project is a demonstration of an Emotion Detection System implemented in Python. It uses machine learning techniques to recognize emotions from images.

## Software Requirements
- Python (version 3.8 - 3.11)

## Installation Guide

Follow these steps to get started with the Emotion Detection System:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sparshcodies/Emotion-Detection-System
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
